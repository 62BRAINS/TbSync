migrate=TbSync is evolving into a central sync manager for multiple protocols, which can be loaded as needed. Therefore, the next version of TbSync will no longer include the ActiveSync provider, which has been moved into a separate ActiveSync provider Add-On.\n\nWithout this provider AddOn you will no longer be able to sync your currently setup ActiveSync accounts, once the next version of TbSync has been released. For a smooth upgrade, it is strongly suggested to install the ActiveSync provider now. Do you want to open its Add-On page for easy installation?
